## **🔧 Manual Deployment Steps**

Since the automated deployment had some issues, here's how to complete it manually:

### **Step 1: Azure Portal Deployment**

1. **Open Azure Portal:**
   - Go to: https://portal.azure.com
   - Sign in with: `i-sjain@quadrantithotmail.onmicrosoft.com`

   - Click on "nexiqon-portal-jan2025"

3. **Set Up GitHub Deployment:**
   - In the left menu, click "Deployment Center"
   - Click "Configure" or "Settings"
   - Choose "GitHub" as source
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select repository: `Siddharthsawale/Sidapp`
   - Select branch: `main`
   - Click "Save"

4. **Trigger Deployment:**
   - Click "Sync" to deploy from GitHub
   - Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)

### **Step 2: Verify Deployment**

1. **Check the URL:** https://nexiqon-portal-jan2025.azurewebsites.net
2. **Test Login:**
   - **Admin:** `admin@nexiqon.com` (any password)
   - **Employee:** `employee@nexiqon.com` (any password)

## **🎯 Alternative: Direct File Upload**

If GitHub deployment doesn't work, you can upload files directly:

1. **In Azure Portal:**
   - Go to your Web App
   - Click "Advanced Tools" (Kudu)
   - Click "Go" to open Kudu
   - Navigate to "Debug Console" > "CMD"
   - Go to `site/wwwroot`
   - Upload your files manually

## **🔍 Troubleshooting**

### **If you see the default Azure page:**
- The deployment didn't work properly
- Follow the manual steps above

### **If you get a 404 error:**
- Check that all files are uploaded
- Verify `startup.py` is in the root directory

### **If login doesn't work:**
- Check database connection
- Verify environment variables are set

## **📞 Support**

If you need help:
1. Check Azure Web App logs in the portal
2. Use the Kudu console for debugging
3. Check GitHub repository for latest code
